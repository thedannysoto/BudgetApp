# BudgetApp
Budget App is a simple budgeting app built in JavaScript with a back end Ruby on Rails API. Users can add transactions to different accounts and budget their money into categories on the main page. This web app uses object-oriented JavaScript with different classes representing Accounts, Transactions, and Categories. The Rails API back end receives new transactions and links them to the specified account and category that the user selects. It also persists category and account balances that are populated in the front end. This app uses the Tabulator JavaScript library along with the Moment.js library to populate the category and transaction tables. TailwindCSS is used for styling the page.
